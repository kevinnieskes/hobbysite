				<p align="left" font color="black">Skies of Arcadia is a game about being a sky pirate. Nothing more really needs to be said about the greatness of this game, but I will anyways. 
				Originally released on Sega's Dreamcast it was later remastered and released on Nintendo's Gamecube. It is a turn based rpg that includes fighting monsters as your characters and turn based airship combat which is probably the single feature that makes it so great.
				It takes place in an open sky with floating islands. Some story related and some out of the way you can discover and sell the locations of for gold. The story follows Vyse a young blue rogue, those are the good pirates, as he seeks to rescue his father from the evil empire who have taken him and his crew captive. 
				From there it evolves into having to save the world. It is great.</p>
